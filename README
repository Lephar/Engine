Game engine as Vulkan practice

Dependencies are rather minimal;
 -Vulkan compatible GPU with up-to-date drivers
 -C17 (bug fix version of C11) compatible version of Clang
 -GLFW library for window creation
 -Vulkan headers for core renderer
 -GLSL compiler for shader compilation

Assuming you are on an up-to-date system, you can get the dependencies as such:
 Arch / Manjaro:
  sudo pacman -S glfw vulkan-devel shaderc clang

 Fedora / CentOS / RHEL:
  sudo dnf install glfw3 vulkan-headers vulkan-validation-layers glslang clang

 Debian / Ubuntu / Elementary / Mint:
  sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev libvulkan-dev vulkan-validationlayers-dev glslang-tools clang

 Solus:
  sudo eopkg install system.devel glfw vulkan-headers vulkan-validation-layers glslang clang

Only Arch based distros have shaderc on their repos,
so you may need to get it yourself on other distros.
Alternatively you can switch to glslangValidator from glslc.
It is also possible to switch to gcc from clang.

And to compile and execute the engine, simply run:
 make
 ./engine.o

Press ESC to switch between the cursor mode and the camera mode.
